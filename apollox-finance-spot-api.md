# General Info
## General API Information

* The base endpoint is: **https://www.apollox.finance**
* All endpoints return either a JSON object or array.
* All time and timestamp related fields are in **milliseconds**.

## API Key Setup

* Some endpoints will require an API Key. 
* Once API key is created, it is recommended to set IP restrictions on the key for security reasons.
* **Never share your API key/secret key to ANYONE.**

<aside class="warning">
If the API keys were accidentally shared, please delete them immediately and create a new key.
</aside>


### HTTP Return Codes
* HTTP `4XX` return codes are used for malformed requests;
  the issue is on the sender's side.
* HTTP `403` return code is used when the WAF Limit (Web Application Firewall) has been violated.
* HTTP `429` return code is used when breaking a request rate limit.
* HTTP `418` return code is used when an IP has been auto-banned for continuing to send requests after receiving `429` codes.
* HTTP `5XX` return codes are used for internal errors; the issue is on ApolloX's side.
  It is important to **NOT** treat this as a failure operation; the execution status is
  **UNKNOWN** and could have been a success.

### Error Codes and Messages

* If there is an error, the API will return an error with a message of the reason.

> The error payload on API is as follows:
 
```javascript
{
  "code": -1121,
  "msg": "Invalid symbol."
}
```

### General Information on Endpoints

* For `GET` endpoints, parameters must be sent as a `query string`.
* For `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` endpoints, the parameters may be sent as a
  `query string` or in the `request body` with content type
  `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. You may mix parameters between both the
  `query string` and `request body` if you wish to do so.
* Parameters may be sent in any order.
* If a parameter sent in both the `query string` and `request body`, the
  `query string` parameter will be used.

---
## LIMITS

### General Info on Limits
* The `/api/v1/exchangeInfo` `rateLimits` array contains objects related to the exchange's `RAW_REQUESTS`, `REQUEST_WEIGHT`, and `ORDERS` rate limits. These are further defined in the `ENUM definitions` section under `Rate limiters (rateLimitType)`.
* A 429 will be returned when either rate limit is violated.

### IP Limits
* Every request will contain `X-MBX-USED-WEIGHT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter)` in the response headers which has the current used weight for the IP for all request rate limiters defined.
* Each route has a `weight` which determines for the number of requests each endpoint counts for. Heavier endpoints and endpoints that do operations on multiple symbols will have a heavier `weight`.
* When a 429 is received, it's your obligation as an API to back off and not spam the API.
* **Repeatedly violating rate limits and/or failing to back off after receiving 429s will result in an automated IP ban (HTTP status 418).**
* IP bans are tracked and **scale in duration** for repeat offenders, **from 2 minutes to 3 days**.
* A `Retry-After` header is sent with a 418 or 429 responses and will give the **number of seconds** required to wait, in the case of a 429, to prevent a ban, or, in the case of a 418, until the ban is over.
* **The limits on the API are based on the IPs, not the API keys.**

<aside class="notice">
We recommend using the websocket for getting data as much as possible, as this will not count to the request rate limit.
</aside>

### Order Rate Limits
* Every successful order response will contain a `X-MBX-ORDER-COUNT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter)` header which has the current order count for the account for all order rate limiters defined.
* Rejected/unsuccessful orders are not guaranteed to have `X-MBX-ORDER-COUNT-**` headers in the response.
* **The order rate limit is counted against each account**.

### Websocket Limits
* WebSocket connections have a limit of 5 incoming messages per second. A message is considered:
    * A PING frame
    * A PONG frame
    * A JSON controlled message (e.g. subscribe, unsubscribe)
* A connection that goes beyond the limit will be disconnected; IPs that are repeatedly disconnected may be banned.
* A single connection can listen to a maximum of 1024 streams.

---

## Endpoint security type
* Each endpoint has a security type that determines how you will
  interact with it. This is stated next to the NAME of the endpoint.
    * If no security type is stated, assume the security type is NONE.
* API-keys are passed into the Rest API via the `X-MBX-APIKEY`
  header.
* API-keys and secret-keys **are case sensitive**.
* API-keys can be configured to only access certain types of secure endpoints.
 For example, one API-key could be used for TRADE only, while another API-key
 can access everything except for TRADE routes.
* By default, API-keys can access all secure routes.

Security Type | Description
------------ | ------------
NONE | Endpoint can be accessed freely.
TRADE | Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key and signature.
USER_DATA | Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key and signature.
USER_STREAM | Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key.
MARKET_DATA | Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key.

* `TRADE` and `USER_DATA` endpoints are `SIGNED` endpoints.

## SIGNED (TRADE AND USER_DATA) Endpoint security
* `SIGNED` endpoints require an additional parameter, `signature`, to be
  sent in the  `query string` or `request body`.
* Endpoints use `HMAC SHA256` signatures. The `HMAC SHA256 signature` is a keyed `HMAC SHA256` operation.
  Use your `secretKey` as the key and `totalParams` as the value for the HMAC operation.
* The `signature` is **not case sensitive**.
* `totalParams` is defined as the `query string` concatenated with the
  `request body`.

### Timing security
* A `SIGNED` endpoint also requires a parameter, `timestamp`, to be sent which
  should be the millisecond timestamp of when the request was created and sent.
* An additional parameter, `recvWindow`, may be sent to specify the number of
  milliseconds after `timestamp` the request is valid for. If `recvWindow`
  is not sent, **it defaults to 5000**.

> The logic is as follows:
```javascript
  if (timestamp < (serverTime + 1000) && (serverTime - timestamp) <= recvWindow)
  {
    // process request
  } 
  else 
  {
    // reject request
  }
```

**Serious trading is about timing.** Networks can be unstable and unreliable,
which can lead to requests taking varying amounts of time to reach the
servers. With `recvWindow`, you can specify that the request must be
processed within a certain number of milliseconds or be rejected by the
server.

<aside class="notice">
It is recommended to use a small recvWindow of 5000 or less! The max cannot go beyond 60,000!
</aside>

## Public API Definitions
### Terminology

These terms will be used throughout the documentation, so it is recommended especially for new users to read to help their understanding of the API.

* `base asset` refers to the asset that is the `quantity` of a symbol. For the symbol BTCUSDT, BTC would be the `base asset.`
* `quote asset` refers to the asset that is the `price` of a symbol. For the symbol BTCUSDT, USDT would be the `quote asset`.

### ENUM definitions
**Symbol status (status):**

* INIT
* PENDING_TRADING
* TRADING


**Order status (status):**

Status | Description
-----------| --------------
`NEW` | The order has been accepted by the engine.
`PARTIALLY_FILLED`| A part of the order has been filled.
`FILLED` | The order has been completed.
`CANCELED` | The order has been canceled by the user.
`REJECTED`       | The order was not accepted by the engine and not processed.
`EXPIRED` | The order was canceled according to the order type's rules (e.g. LIMIT FOK orders with no fill, LIMIT IOC or MARKET orders that partially fill) or by the exchange, (e.g. orders canceled during maintenance)


**Order types (orderTypes, type):**

* LIMIT
* MARKET
* STOP
* TAKE_PROFIT

**Order Response Type (newOrderRespType):**

* ACK

* SELL

**Time in force (timeInForce):**

This sets how long an order will be active before expiration.

Status | Description
-----------| --------------
`GTC` | Good Till Canceled <br> An order will be on the book unless the order is canceled. 
`IOC` | Immediate Or Cancel <br> An order will try to fill the order as much as it can before the order expires.
`FOK`| Fill or Kill <br> An order will expire if the full order cannot be filled upon execution.
`GTX`| Good Till Crossing <br>  Post only order

## Filters
Filters define trading rules on a symbol or an exchange.
Filters come in two forms: `symbol filters` and `exchange filters`. Currently only `symbol filters` is used.

### Symbol Filters

#### PRICE_FILTER

> **ExchangeInfo format:**
```javascript    
  {                     
	"minPrice": "556.72",
    "maxPrice": "4529764",
    "filterType": "PRICE_FILTER",
    "tickSize": "0.01"   
  }  
```

The `PRICE_FILTER` defines the `price` rules for a symbol. There are 3 parts:

* `minPrice` defines the minimum `price`/`stopPrice` allowed; disabled on `minPrice` == 0.
* `maxPrice` defines the maximum `price`/`stopPrice` allowed; disabled on `maxPrice` == 0.
* `tickSize` defines the intervals that a `price`/`stopPrice` can be increased/decreased by; disabled on `tickSize` == 0.

Any of the above variables can be set to 0, which disables that rule in the `price filter`. In order to pass the `price filter`, the following must be true for `price`/`stopPrice` of the enabled rules:

* `price` >= `minPrice` 
* `price` <= `maxPrice`
* (`price`-`minPrice`) % `tickSize` == 0


#### PERCENT_PRICE

> **ExchangeInfo format:**
```javascript    
  {                    
	"multiplierDown": "0.9500",
	"multiplierUp": "1.0500",
	"multiplierDecimal": "4",
	"filterType": "PERCENT_PRICE"
  }  
```

The `PERCENT_PRICE` filter defines valid range for a price based on the index price.

In order to pass the `percent price`, the following must be true for `price`:  

* `price` <=`indexPrice` *`multiplierUp`
* `price`> =`indexPrice` *`multiplierDown`    


#### LOT_SIZE

> **ExchangeInfo format:**
```javascript    
  {
    "stepSize": "0.00100000",
    "filterType": "LOT_SIZE",
    "maxQty": "100000.00000000",
    "minQty": "0.00100000"
  }  
```

The `LOT_SIZE` filter defines the `quantity` (aka "lots" in auction terms) rules for a symbol. There are 3 parts:

* `minQty` defines the minimum `quantity` allowed.
* `maxQty` defines the maximum `quantity` allowed.
* `stepSize` defines the intervals that a `quantity` can be increased/decreased by.

In order to pass the `lot size`, the following must be true for `quantity`:

* `quantity` >= `minQty`
* `quantity` <= `maxQty`
* (`quantity`-`minQty`) % `stepSize` == 0




#### MARKET_LOT_SIZE

> **ExchangeInfo format:**
```javascript
  {      
	"stepSize": "0.00100000",
  "filterType": "MARKET_LOT_SIZE"
	"maxQty": "100000.00000000",
	"minQty": "0.00100000"    
  }
```


The `MARKET_LOT_SIZE` filter defines the `quantity` (aka "lots" in auction terms) rules for `MARKET` orders on a symbol. There are 3 parts:

* `minQty` defines the minimum `quantity` allowed.
* `maxQty` defines the maximum `quantity` allowed.
* `stepSize` defines the intervals that a `quantity` can be increased/decreased by.

In order to pass the `market lot size`, the following must be true for `quantity`:

* `quantity` >= `minQty`
* `quantity` <= `maxQty`
* (`quantity`-`minQty`) % `stepSize` == 0

Additional mandatory parameters based on `type`:

Type | Additional mandatory parameters
------------ | ------------ 
`LIMIT` | `timeInForce`, `quantity`, `price`
`MARKET` | `SELL` with `quantity` 或 `BUY` with `quoteOrderQty`
`STOP`和`TAKE_PROFIT` | `quantity`,  `price`, `stopPrice`  

Other info:

* `MARKET` `SELL` orders using the `quantity` field specifies the amount of the `base asset` the user wants to sell at the market price.
 * For example, sending a `MARKET` `SELL` order on BTCUSDT will specify how much BTC the user is selling.
* `MARKET` `BUY` orders using `quoteOrderQty` specifies the amount the user wants to spend the `quote` asset; the correct `quantity` will be determined based on the market liquidity and `quoteOrderQty`.
 * For example, sending a `MARKET` `BUY` order on BTCUSDT specify how much USDT the user is using to buy. The order will buy as many BTC as `quoteOrderQty` USDT can.
* `MARKET` orders using `quoteOrderQty` will not break `LOT_SIZE` filter rules; the order will execute a `quantity` that will have the notional value as close as possible to `quoteOrderQty`.
* same `newClientOrderId` can be accepted only when the previous one is filled, otherwise the order will be rejected.

# Websocket Market Streams

* The base endpoint is: **wss://stream.apollox.finance**
* Streams can be accessed either in a single raw stream or in a combined stream
* Raw streams are accessed at **/ws/\<streamName\>**
* Combined streams are accessed at **/stream?streams=\<streamName1\>/\<streamName2\>/\<streamName3\>**
* Combined stream events are wrapped as follows: **{"stream":"\<streamName\>","data":\<rawPayload\>}**
* All symbols for streams are **lowercase**
* A single connection to **stream.apollox.finance** is only valid for 24 hours; expect to be disconnected at the 24 hour mark
* The websocket server will send a `ping frame` every 3 minutes. If the websocket server does not receive a `pong frame` back from the connection within a 10 minute period, the connection will be disconnected. Unsolicited `pong frames` are allowed.

## Live Subscribing/Unsubscribing to streams

* The following data can be sent through the websocket instance in order to subscribe/unsubscribe from streams. Examples can be seen below.
* The `id` used in the JSON payloads is an unsigned INT used as an identifier to uniquely identify the messages going back and forth.
* In the response, if the `result` received is `null` this means the request sent was a success.

### Subscribe to a stream

Order book price and quantity depth updates used to locally manage an order book.
 
**Stream Name:** `<symbol>@depth` OR `<symbol>@depth@100ms`

**Update Speed:** 1000ms or 100ms



## How to manage a local order book correctly
1. Open a stream to **wss://stream.apollox.finance/ws/bnbbtc@depth**.
2. Buffer the events you receive from the stream.
3. Get a depth snapshot from **https://www.apollox.finance/api/v1/depth?symbol=BNBBTC&limit=1000** .
4. Drop any event where `u` is <= `lastUpdateId` in the snapshot.
5. The first processed event should have `U` <= `lastUpdateId`+1 **AND** `u` >= `lastUpdateId`+1.
6. While listening to the stream, each new event's `U` should be equal to the previous event's `u`+1.
7. The data in each event is the **absolute** quantity for a price level.
8. If the quantity is 0, **remove** the price level.
9. Receiving an event that removes a price level that is not in your local order book can happen and is normal.






# User Data Streams


* The base API endpoint is: **https://www.apollox.finance**
* A User Data Stream `listenKey` is valid for 60 minutes after creation.
* Doing a `PUT` on a `listenKey` will extend its validity for 60 minutes.
* Doing a `DELETE` on a `listenKey` will close the stream and invalidate the `listenKey`.
* Doing a `POST` on an account with an active `listenKey` will return the currently active `listenKey` and extend its validity for 60 minutes.
* The base websocket endpoint is: **wss://stream.apollox.finance**
* User Data Streams are accessed at **/ws/\<listenKey\>**
* A single connection to **stream.apollox.finance** is only valid for 24 hours; expect to be disconnected at the 24 hour mark
